    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the best French toast recipe. It's different because it uses flour. I have given it to some friends and they've all liked it better than the French toast they usually make! This fluffy French toast recipe is crisp on the outside, but perfectly soft and tender on the inside.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>12 thick slices bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Measure flour into a large mixing bowl. Slowly whisk in milk. Whisk in eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Meanwhile, soak bread slices in milk mixture until saturated.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, cook bread on the preheated griddle or pan until golden brown on each side.</li>
